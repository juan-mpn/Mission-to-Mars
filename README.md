Python Pandas, MongoDB,  Flask, Scraping (splinter and beautiful soup modules) from NASA webpage content and using bootstrap CSS notation to present it in a profesional way. Also created portfolio web page that lists contact information, GitHum and Social media links along with different examples showing the work done. 

## Background

## Objectives 
The goals for this challenge are for you to:

Scrape the data from 'https://mars.nasa.gov/news/', utilizing Chromedriver.exe and inpspect content to later scrape. Also doing the same with Hemisphere information. 

This was a very challengin project due to all the dependencies and complexities to have everything working in the proper steps cover and writing code with proper identation is key. 


We can also see that the Average Fare per Driver is some times 4 times higher in rural areas, we can see this is the impact of having a lot less drivers available 78 vs 490 for suburban areas and 2,405 for the Urban areas. This is very interesting data.
